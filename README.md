# React Router DOM v6 Nested Route Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when working with nested routes in React Router DOM v6.  The nested routes unexpectedly fail to render, despite appearing to be correctly configured.

## Bug Description
Nested routes within the application do not render as expected. The parent route renders, but its children do not. This occurs despite no apparent errors in the console or configuration.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the nested routes.  You will observe that the nested routes do not render.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the route configurations, ensuring correct path definitions, and potentially addressing any conflicts or unintended behavior within the routing logic.

This repository contains both the buggy version and a corrected version to illustrate the problem and its solution.
